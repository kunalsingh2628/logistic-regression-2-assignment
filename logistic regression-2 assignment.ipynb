    " Purpose of Grid Search CV:\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid Search Cross-Validation (Grid Search CV) is a technique used in machine learning to find the best hyperparameters for a model.\n",
    "Hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned from the data but are set prior to the training process. Examples include learning rates, regularization strengths, and kernel types.\n",
    "Grid Search involves specifying a grid of hyperparameter values and training the model with all possible combinations of these values. Cross-validation is employed to evaluate the model's performance for each set of hyperparameters.\n",
    "The purpose is to identify the hyperparameter combination that yields the best model performance according to a specified evaluation metric."
